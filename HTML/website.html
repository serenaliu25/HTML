  <p>A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by
  several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.
  In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
  distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
  and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
  starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
  when ripe. </p>
  <p>Raw bananas <strong>(not including the peel)</strong> are 75% water, 23% carbohydrates, 1%
  protein, and contain negligible fat. A 100-gram reference serving supplies 89
  Calories, 31% of the US recommended Daily Value (DV) of vitamin B6, and moderate
  amounts of vitamin C, manganese and dietary fiber, with no other micronutrients
  in significant content </p>

  <p>Here is a quote from a banana company's website:
    <blockquote cite="https://www.chiquita.com/blog/benefits-of-bananas-bananas-are-one-of-the-best-superfoods/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20many%20reasons,and%20help%20with%20muscle%20function.">
      Bananas are naturally fat and cholesterol free and a
      natural sweetener. What could be healthier than that? You can snack freely on
      bananas all day, every day, and never have to wonder, “are bananas good for you?”
      ever again.
